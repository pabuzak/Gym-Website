                    <h1>Bodybuilding & Workout Plan</h1>
                    <p>Bodybuilding is different from powerlifting as it is judged on physical appearance rather then physical strength.
                        If you're just starting out, it's really going to depend on your work schedule and hours that you can train, but I would suggest to try and get in three days a week and split them every other day.
                        Start with basic exercises for each body part and do two exercisesâ€”3 sets of 8-12 reps for each part. Ensure that you have good form on all the excerices for the following split to get maximum results:

                    <h1>Powerlifting & Workout Plan</h1>
                    <p>Powerlifting is is all about your physical strength and trying to progress stronger in basic compound lifts (squat, bench and deadlift). While it can have some carryover to building muscle, 
                        powerlifting's main focus is one-rep strength in the big three.

                    <h1>Nutritional information</h1>
                    <p>Nutrition is the most important thing to start your journey in the gym. People have different goals and therefore, this post will go through different
                       diet plans. 
                    <h4>Bodybuilding Diet</h4>
                    <p>First thing you need to ensure is how many calories you need for your goals. If you want to lose weight and body fat you would want to go on caloric deficit meaning you would eat less then your maintanace calories which can be found via calorie calculators online. You would want
                        to be in a caloric deficit if you are clasified as overweight or obese when beginning. If you want to gain weight you would want to go on a caloric surplus meaning you would eat more then your maintance calories. This would be helpful for people who are underweight and are
                        'hard gainers'. With people who are in the middle (aka skinny fat), there have been many cases where going on a recomposition or slight surplus causes a huge increase in muscle mass and strength which can be done by either eating at maintaince calories or 100-150 calories above maintance calories.

                    <h4>Powerlifting Diet</h4>
                    <p>The powerlifting diet would be a bulking or a caloric surplus diet as you would want to gain as much strength as possible. However, this must be done in a
                        well-planned way to not gain a lot of body fat all at once in the process not helping you at all in the long run. It is very important to have the right amount
                        of carbohydrates, fats and espeically protein in your diet.
